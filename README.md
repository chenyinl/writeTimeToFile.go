## Background
When we are running a CRON job, we sometimes needs to know when the last time the job was executed. Even though the job was scheduled, but sometimes the job run longer then expected, or there was a problem from third party so the job was not successfully. So I wrote this code to log down when the last job was done.

## Install
Install like regular Golang file.

## Deployment
Deploy like regular Golang work.

## Usage
If the file was not compiled, we can just run like:
```
> go run writeFile.go
```
## Output
Below is an example of how the file looks like after being called for 16 times.
